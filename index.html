  <h1>10.05.05 - Object Enhancement Exercises</h1>
  <p>Please refer to the JavaScript file to see how spread and rest were used in the functions.</p>
  <p>Exercises involved refactoring and using the object shorthand, methods, and computed property names.</p>
  <p>Exercise required refactoring a function that used the same named keys shortcut, refactoring an object that
    had a computed a property key, and refactoring an object to use methods. The final function, createAnimal,
    involved tying the first 3 exercises together since the object returned by the function had a property name
    that needed to match a parameter, had a dynamically named parameter that was a method.</p>
  <p>Jasmine tests were included to test each part of the exercise.</p>
