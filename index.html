  <h1>10.05.05 - Object Enhancement Exercises</h1>
  <p>Please refer to the JavaScript file to see how spread and rest were used in the functions.</p>
  <p>For <strong>mergeObjects(obj1, obj2)</strong>, it is coded so any key/value pair in obj1 is REPLACED by the
    key/value pair found in obj2. They are not combined, key/values that exist in both obj1 and obj2 are always
    REPLACED by key/values in obj2.</p>
  <p><strong>mergeCombineObjects(obj1, obj2)</strong> is a new, unrequested function that came of the replace that
    occurs in mergeObject. . . and it was also the code initially written for mergeObjects before realizing how to
    use spread with an object. With mergeCombineObjects, obj2 is merged into obj1 BUT if the key already exists,
    the value from obj2 is combined -- numbers are added together, strings are concatenated and really did not
    code for many what-if scenarios. </p>
  <p>For <strong>update(obj, key, val)</strong>, the interpretation of 'update' means to update / change a
    value that <u>exists</u> and it was coded to ensure the value change only occurs when the key exists.</p>
