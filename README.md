# sb_10-05-05_Object_Enhancements_Exercises
Completed exercises that involved refactoring and using the object shorthand, methods, and computed property names.

Exercise required refactoring a function that used the same named keys shortcut, refactoring an object that had a computed a property key, and refactoring an object to use methods. The final function, createAnimal, involved tying the first 3 exercises together since the object returned by the function had a property name that needed to match a parameter, had a 
dynamically named parameter that was a method.

Jasmine tests were included to test each part of the exercise.
